# Git workflow for working with multiple people

This sets the current PR to be at the head of the main branch and allows for merging conflicts on local machine without overwriting other people's work >:)

## Rebasing

After you commit your changes to your feature branch `<some-feature-branch>`

checkout the main branch (or whatever branch you want to smoothly merge to)
```Bash
git checkout main
```
Pull in the new stuff
```Bash
git pull origin main
```

Checkout your feature and rebase main to it

```Bash
git checkout <some-feature-branch>
git rebase main
```

Git will whine about merge conflicts, fix them and repeat these steps until git stops whining:

```Bash
git add <file-name>   # stage the merged conflicts
git rebase --continue # move to the next commit 
```

Then (force, if a PR is already made and the remote branch already exists NOT IF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BASED work off of it i.e. they have already pulled the branch and merged it into their work or something) push the merged conflicts to the remote branch:

```Bash
git push --force-with-lease origin <some-feature-branch>
```

And make a PR / request merge to main using GitHub's UI


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
